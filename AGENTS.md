## Code Search

Use the semble mcp for code search.

### Workflow

1. Start with `semble search` to find relevant chunks.
2. Inspect full files only when the returned chunk is not enough context.
3. Optionally use `semble find-related` with a promising result's `file_path` and `line` to discover related implementations.
4. Use grep only when you need exhaustive literal matches or quick confirmation of an exact string.
